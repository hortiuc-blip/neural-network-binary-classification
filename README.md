# neural-network-binary-classification
Binary classification with a neural network implemented from scratch and with TensorFlow. Practice project based on handwritten digit recognition (0 vs 1).
This project explores binary classification using neural networks, covering both:
- implementation from scratch using NumPy
- practical implementation with TensorFlow

The goal is to build an intuitive understanding of supervised learning, optimization, and model evaluation.
